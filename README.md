## Reflections and Comments

- This project hase been a roller coaster! I feel as though I always felt pretty comfortable with HTML but JS and CSS has thrown me for a loop! I have struggled through this entire project, but in the end I'm pretty proud of the outcome! I'm excited to see it grow and develop more along the way!
